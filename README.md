# course-2016-spr-proj-zero
Test project repository for the Spring 2016 iteration of the Data Mechanics course at Boston University.

Suppose that you have two team members `alice@bu.edu` and `bob@bu.edu` with the GitHub usernames `alicegh` and `bobgh`. To complete this project, fork this repository and add a single directory with a name of the form `alice_bob` (ascending alphabetical order and separated by an underscore); for a single member, the directory name would simply be `alice`. Within the directory, add a single file `members.txt` containing the mappings from members' GitHub user names to their BU login names (one mapping per line).

For example, Alice and Bob would create a single file `./alice_bob/members.txt` with the following contents:
```
alicegh:alice
bobgh:bob
```
